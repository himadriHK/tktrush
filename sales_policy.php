                                    Our goal as “ Ticket Rush ” is to make your purchasing experience easy, efficient and equitable, so we can get you on your way to live events as quickly as possible. The following purchase policies are designed to ensure your satisfaction and understanding of the purchase process on tktrush.com This Purchase Policy establishes a part of our Usage Conditions. We hereby state that you will be deemed as read, understood and agreed the provisions of the Purchase Policy fully by being a member with our website and/or purchasing a ticket; and please visit our FAQ page before any purchase in the event of that you have any request or complain pursuant to the provisions of this Purchase Policy.<br/><br/>
                                    <strong>SALES POLICY</strong><br/>
                                    1. As an authorized ticket agent, Ticket Rush sells tickets on behalf of the venue, promoter or producer that produces the event for which you buy a ticket. We refer to the venue, promoter, or producer from whom we obtain tickets to sell to you as our "Event Partner". Tickets purchased from Ticket Rush are subject to a per ticket service charge and a non-refundable per order handling charge. Ticket Rush does not set ticket prices or determine seating plans. The person who purchases a ticket hereby declares and undertakes that this ticket remains the property of the Event Partner and is a personal revocable license, which may be withdrawn and admission refused at any time upon refunding the printed purchase price. A ticket shall not be used for advertising, promotions, contests or sweepstakes, unless the Event Provider gives formal written permission. Unlawful resale (or attempted unlawful resale) of a ticket is grounds for seizure or cancellation of that ticket without refund or other compensation.<br/><br/>
                                    2. You can only purchase tickets from Ticket Rush within the ticket purchase limit predefined for the event. This ticket purchase limit is defined in the first page of purchase. It is aimed through this application to prevent the unfair ticket purchases. Tickets may be restricted to a maximum number per person, per credit card and, for some events; a restriction may apply per household. We reserve the right to cancel tickets without prior notice purchased in excess of this number. Ticket Rush accept payments online using Visa and MasterCard credit/debit card in AED (United Arab Emirates Dirhams) , being UAE as Ticket Rush country of domicile. If “Credit Card Online” is selected as the payment method, the details on the customer’s ID (Card holders ID) should exactly match that of the credit card used to make the purchase.<br/><br/>
                                    3. The tickets are generally sold through various sales channels including the Internet, Call Center, Ticket Rush Retail Outlets. As all the sales channels are using the same ticketing system and inventory therefore popular events’ tickets may be sold out quickly. Occasionally, additional tickets may be available prior to the event, however Ticket Rush does not control this inventory or its availability.<br/><br/>
                                    4. If you select “courier delivery” option for your tickets, it is required that you will be at the delivery address on the date of the delivery and you need to present an official proof of your identification and the credit card that you used for the payment for the ticket(s). For security purposes the courier may not deliver the tickets any person other than the credit card holder. The courier charge has been collected from your credit card during the purchase; therefore you should not make any payment to the courier. In the case of indicating an address outside the delivery areas of courier services, it is not possible to deliver the tickets. Delivery information such as Customers Name, Location Address and Contact Number will be stored for delivery purposes only. Other personal identifiable information will not be stored.<br/><br/>
                                    5. It is your responsibility to control and protect your tickets. Please store your tickets in a secure place once you will obtain them. Please note that direct sunlight or heat can sometimes damage tickets.<br/><br/>
                                    6. Occasionally, events are cancelled or postponed by the promoter, team, performer or venue for a variety of reasons. If the event is cancelled, refund procedures will be announced by the Event Partner. If the event was moved or rescheduled, the venue or promoter may set refund limitations. It is your responsibility to ascertain whether an event has been cancelled and the date and time of any events. If an event is cancelled or rescheduled, we will use reasonable endeavors to notify ticket holders of the cancellation once we have received the relevant authorization from the Event Partner. We do not guarantee that ticket holders will be informed of such cancellation before the date of the event.<br/><br/>
                                    7. As a general rule, all ticket sales are final and non-refundable. Policies set forth by Event Partners, prohibit us from issuing exchanges or refunds after a purchase has been made or for lost, stolen, damaged or destroyed tickets. Tickets cannot be exchanged or refunded after purchase unless the performance is cancelled. If the ticket holder is unable to attend the rescheduled event a full refund will be offered. Full refunds for tickets purchased prior to the date of the original event will be given up to the face value of the tickets purchased plus the relevant per ticket service charge. All the refunds of any transaction’s amount against any purchase through this website would be refunded to the original mode of payment.<br/>
                                    If the event was moved or rescheduled, the venue or Event Partners may set refund limitations. Additionally, Event Partners have right to alter or vary the program due to events or circumstances beyond its reasonable control without being obliged to refund monies or exchange tickets. It is the customer’s responsibility to comply with the latest refund date and other instructions as defined by the Event Partners. In this sense Ticket Rush has no liability whatsoever for such transactions. In order to make refund for the cancelled or postponed events, the tickets should be physically delivered to the Ticket Rush Retail Outlets.
