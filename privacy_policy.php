                                    We want you to know that protecting your personal information is very important to us, and we respect your privacy. This Privacy Policy is meant to explain how we use and protect the personal information you share with us. This Policy applies to all users of www.tktrush.com or our services, and to any information provided to us. By using our website, you are consenting to the practices set forth in this Privacy Policy.<br/>
                                    Information collected through tktrush.com does not include credit card details of the customers and those details will not be stored, sold, shared, rented or leased to any third parties.<br/>
                                    Ticket Rush complies with the privacy laws and regulations of UAE. Those who choose to access the Site do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying with all local laws, rules and regulations. By using this Site, visitors from outside of UAE acknowledge this Site is subject to the laws and regulations of UAE, and waive any claims that may arise under their own national laws.<br/>
                                    Ticket Rush reserves the right to change, modify, add, or remove provisions of this Privacy Policy.. Therefore the Customers must be notified about these changes as well as the Payment Gateway Provider, such modifications will become effective on the day they are posted, and encourage you to frequently review the Privacy Policy for any modifications.

                                    <strong>1. What Information We Collect</strong><br/>
                                    a) Non-Personally Identifiable Information. When you visit and interact with the Site, Ticket Rush and third parties with whom Ticket Rush has contracted to provide services to Ticket Rush may collect Non-PII (for example, a catalog of the Site pages you visit). Non-PII is anonymous and does not identify you personally. Non-PII is generally collected through the Site from four different sources: Internet protocol addresses and web logs; cookies; pixel tags and other similar technologies; and other Non-PII that you voluntarily provide (as explained below).<br/>
                                    b) IP Protocol Addresses and Web Logs. This Site's web servers automatically collect the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses and log files of visitors. Your IP address is an identifying number that is automatically assigned to your computer by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This number is identified and logged automatically in our server log files whenever you visit the Site, along with the time(s) of your visit(s) and the page(s) that you visited. This information is collected in an aggregate form only and does not contain any PII. We use your IP address, and the IP addresses of all users, for purposes such as calculating Site usage levels, helping diagnose problems with the Site's servers, and administering the Site. Collecting IP addresses is standard practice on the Internet and is done automatically by many websites. In addition to the Non-PII usage of IP Addresses described above we also may link your IP address to personally identifiable information for fraud prevention purposes.<br/>
                                    c) Cookies. We and our third party service providers may use a standard technology called a "cookie" to collect information about how you use the Site. Cookies reside on your computer and help the Site recognize your computer's browser as a previous visitor. For example, when you sign in to your Ticket Rush account, cookies will be used to save your email address and name so the next time you visit Ticket Rush from the same computer we will "remember" your email address and name in order to make your experience faster and simpler. On occasion our Site may also set a "session cookie" which helps us administer the Site. The session cookie expires when you close your browser and does not retain any information about you after it expires. If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies, you should be able to modify your browser preference to provide you with choices relating to cookies. If you choose to reject cookies, you may be unable to use certain Site services (e.g., those services that require you to log on to the Site in order to participate).<br/>
                                    d) Pixel Tags. We and our service providers may also use so-called "pixel tags," "web beacons," "clear GIFs" or similar means (collectively, "Pixel Tags") in connection with some Site pages and HTML-formatted email messages to track your use of our website in order to provide you with more useful information and a more personalized experience the next time you visit. A Pixel Tag is an electronic image, often a single pixel (1x1), that is ordinarily not visible to Site visitors and may be associated with cookies on the visitors' hard drives. Pixel Tags do not contain any PII and allow us to count users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help determine the effectiveness of promotional or advertising campaigns. When used in HTML-formatted email messages, Pixel Tags can tell the sender whether and when an email has been opened.<br/><br/>
                                    <strong>2. How Information We Collect Is Used</strong><br/>
                                    a) Non-Personally Identifiable Information. Because Non-PII does not personally identify you, we may use such information for any purpose. For example, we may use Non-PII to measure the number of visits, average time spent on the Site and pages viewed as well as to diagnose problems with our servers and to administer the Site. We may then use this information to analyze and improve the features and functionality of this Site. In addition, we reserve the right to share such Non-PII, which does not personally identify you, with third parties, for any purpose. For example, we may share information with advertisers or other third parties that are not part of Ticket Rush family on an aggregate or other basis that does not disclose any of your identity.<br/>
                                    b) Newsletter Subscription. Once you become a website member, you shall receive at your e-mail address weekly notification e-mails as well as messages customized for your interests, unless you request otherwise. You have the option at any time to effect changes to these e-mail messages, discontinue the service or reactivate it. Said e-mail messages may contain information regarding events that you purchased, other events that we assume to be of interest to you, third party advertisements and similar content.<br/><br/>
                                    Offline vs. Online practices. Please note that this Privacy Policy applies solely to our online information gathering and dissemination practices in connection with the Site, and does not apply to any of our practices conducted offline.
